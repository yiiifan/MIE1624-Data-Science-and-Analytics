For example, we know what multiplying a matrix and a vector means, where as multiplying a two dimensional array and a one dimensional array is not uniquely defined.  There *is* a matrix object in NumPy but we will not use those in this notebook.  Due to the fact that we are using arrays instead of matrices this means we will need to use the function `np.dot` when we multiply a matrix and a vector. See below for details.\n",
